<p id="tribute-info"></a>Nobody understood you, yet we all felt you. This is just an anonymous but necessary gratitude message for sharing your pain and wisdom. You would be surprised how much we talk and praise ourselves nowadays and how little we act upon it, the bridge to our essence is every day wider. You were so close to it, yet it brought you huge pain because society is cruel towards unity.
